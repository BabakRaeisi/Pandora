Note: UI Builder Color Mismatch (Known Issue):
UI Toolkit’s UI Builder preview currently renders in Gamma color space.
If your project uses Linear color space, colors in the UI Builder may look different from the actual Game View.
This is a known issue, and Unity is aware of it.

Recommended Workflow:
Always adjust colors while viewing the Game View, not the UI Builder preview.
